					<h3>Evaluation of the Literature Review</h3>

					<p><strong>Knowledge and Understanding:</strong> This review demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of the complexities surrounding state-sponsored cyberterrorism. Key issues such as attribution difficulty, critical infrastructure vulnerability, and gaps in global governance were explored using both foundational and contemporary literature. The inclusion of theoretical tensions made the review analytically sound, though regional comparisons could have been expanded to show a more comparative lens.</p>

					<p><strong>Criticality:</strong> The analysis reflected a thoughtful engagement with literature, especially around ambiguity in cyber operations and the limits of attribution. There was a clear effort to question definitions and explore state motivations critically. Further critical depth could have been added by interrogating more directly why definitional fragmentation persists and how this impacts international cooperation.</p>

					<p><strong>Use of Sources:</strong> The submission drew heavily on peer-reviewed and institutional sources, showing academic integrity and relevance. There was some use of grey literature, but the balance favoured quality evidence. Future work could consider triangulating across more diverse methodologies (e.g. empirical case studies or technical threat reports) to enrich the discussion.</p>

					<p><strong>Structure and Presentation:</strong> The document followed a logical flow, with a strong introduction and structured headings. Language was academic and concise. However, clearer summaries at the end of sections and an abstract would have helped tie points together more tightly. Minor formatting inconsistencies could be smoothed out for improved presentation.</p>

					<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> Referencing followed the correct Harvard style throughout, with full citations and no plagiarism detected. Arguments were evidence-based and clearly attributed, meeting expectations of scholarly rigour.</p>
