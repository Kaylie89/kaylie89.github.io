					<h3>Evaluation of the Literature Review</h3>

					<p><strong>Knowledge and Understanding:</strong> The literature review demonstrated clear understanding of the complexities surrounding state-sponsored cyberterrorism, especially issues of attribution and international instability. Relevant frameworks and global case studies were used effectively, although greater integration of recent regional incidents (e.g., Eastern Europe or Asia-Pacific) would have further strengthened the global applicability.</p>

					<p><strong>Criticality:</strong> Efforts were made to challenge the assumption that cyberterrorism is easily attributable or universally defined. There was a consistent attempt to explore competing viewpoints and highlight definitional ambiguity. However, I could have gone further in interrogating why states may benefit from maintaining blurred definitions or how academic disagreement weakens governance responses.</p>

					<p><strong>Use of Sources:</strong> A balanced range of academic, legal, and technical sources were used, drawing from both peer-reviewed and credible grey literature. While a few citations could have been more current, the breadth and relevance were generally strong. I made a conscious effort to prioritise interdisciplinary sources to reflect the topicâ€™s complexity.</p>

					<p><strong>Structure and Presentation:</strong> The overall structure followed a logical progression and included appropriate academic conventions. Future improvements would involve clearer subheadings to enhance readability and a more concise conclusion that reinforces key insights.</p>

					<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> All citations were referenced using the correct Harvard format, and I ensured that all paraphrasing was accurate and appropriately attributed. I also used Turnitin to self-check originality prior to submission.</p>

					<p>Overall, the literature review reflected meaningful engagement with a complex and emerging area of cybersecurity. Through this process, I developed stronger skills in critical synthesis, source evaluation, and articulating academic arguments across disciplinary boundaries.</p>
