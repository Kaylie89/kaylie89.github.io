					<h3>Evaluation of Statistical Exercises</h3>

					<p>This section involved practical application of statistical techniques using SPSS to analyse cybersecurity-related scenarios. Core tests included the independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearsonâ€™s correlation, and the Chi-square test. Each reinforced essential skills for quantitative inquiry within the computing domain.</p>

					<p>The t-test exercise helped determine whether observed differences in means were statistically significant, such as comparing user response times to two different security protocols. This supported interpretation of intervention effects and built confidence in applying inferential statistics.</p>

					<p>The ANOVA task, which was initially more complex, provided valuable insight into comparing outcomes across more than two groups. For instance, it supported analysis of malware detection success rates across different antivirus tools. The importance of conducting post-hoc tests became clear when determining which specific groups differed significantly.</p>

					<p>Correlation analysis enabled exploration of linear relationships, such as between training hours and phishing email detection rates. Meanwhile, the Chi-square test was useful for evaluating associations between categorical variables, such as the relationship between job role and security breach awareness. This is a common concern in cybersecurity audits and workforce segmentation.</p>

					<p>Beyond running these tests, the most significant learning came from interpreting SPSS outputs accurately and translating them into clear, actionable findings. This included checking assumptions such as normality, homogeneity of variance, and expected cell counts. These are easy to overlook but critical to statistical validity. Identifying and correcting such issues sharpened attention to detail and improved analytical judgement.</p>

					<p>Writing interpretations in plain language, avoiding jargon, and supporting conclusions with correct statistical terminology strengthened communication skills. This is a key asset when conveying technical results to non-specialist stakeholders such as business leaders or compliance teams.</p>

					<p>Overall, completing these exercises reinforced foundational statistical concepts and promoted rigour in data-driven research. These insights directly informed the research proposal design, including the selection of suitable tests based on data type, sampling considerations, and the need for ethical data handling in adversarial AI and cybersecurity contexts.</p>
