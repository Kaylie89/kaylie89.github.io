					<h3>Statistical Exercises Portfolio</h3>

					<p>This section showcases the statistical analysis tasks completed in Units 8 and 9. Each was conducted in Excel following structured guidance from the module’s exercise sheets and data annexes. The activities aimed to develop practical competence in hypothesis testing, interpretation of outputs, and effective data presentation—key to research in computing and cybersecurity.</p>

					<h4>Unit 8: Statistical Inference</h4>
					<p>Unit 8 focused on core inferential techniques introduced through guided worksheets and worked examples. Each task required data cleaning, running specific tests, and interpreting outputs in context.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Exe 8.1B – T-Test (Diets Dataset):</strong> This exercise involved comparing weight loss outcomes between two diet plans using a two-sample t-test. Guided steps highlighted how to check for equal variances. The result showed a statistically significant difference between groups, supporting the hypothesis that the diets had different effects.</li>

						<li><strong>Exe 8.2B – Chi-Square Test (Brand Preferences):</strong> The instructions focused on evaluating relationships between categorical variables using contingency tables. The test found no statistically significant association between gender and brand preference, supporting the assumption of independence between the two.</li>

						<li><strong>Exe 8.3D – Pearson’s Correlation (Heather Dataset):</strong> The guidance walked through calculating correlation coefficients and scatterplots. A moderate positive correlation was found between canopy height and cover, reinforcing the importance of visualising linear relationships before drawing conclusions.</li>

						<li><strong>Exe 8.4G – One-Way ANOVA (Superplus Dataset):</strong> This task involved comparing satisfaction ratings across different product groups. The guide stressed checking assumptions of normality and homogeneity. The results revealed a statistically significant difference, prompting use of post-hoc tests to identify which groups varied.</li>

						<li><strong>Exe 8.6C – Two-Way ANOVA (Designs Dataset):</strong> This final inferential task involved exploring the effect of two independent variables and their interaction. Following the guide’s framework, I identified a main effect of one variable and a weak interaction effect, highlighting how design and type may jointly influence user satisfaction.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>All Unit 8 exercises emphasised the importance of selecting the correct test, checking assumptions, and contextualising significance levels. Interpretation guidance from the module ensured results were explained in plain language, without over-interpreting p-values.</p>

					<h4>Unit 9: Charts and Visualisation</h4>
					<p>Unit 9 focused on representing data clearly for different audiences. The workbook exercises and instructions guided chart selection and formatting best practices for ethical, accurate communication.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Exe 9.1D – Descriptive Statistics and Basic Charts:</strong> The task included calculating measures of central tendency and creating basic visualisations. I followed the guide’s recommendation to use bar charts and histograms to present frequency distributions and identify skew.</li>

						<li><strong>Exe 9.2D – Comparison and Trend Charts:</strong> Instructions focused on comparing group outcomes and trends over time. I produced line and clustered column charts, reflecting trends in response patterns. The guide also highlighted how to label and scale axes for clarity.</li>

						<li><strong>Exe 9.3B / Exa 9.3B – Pie and Stacked Column Charts:</strong> These tasks explored proportions and group breakdowns. The guidance explained the limitations of pie charts in comparing categories and encouraged the use of stacked bar charts as an alternative. Both were created and critiqued accordingly.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Summary</h4>
					<p>Each Excel file contains the original dataset, step-by-step calculations, and final visual outputs, with interpretation notes embedded as comments or captions. Screenshots and annotations show adherence to the instructions.</p>

					<p>All tasks were completed independently using the official module materials, including the walkthrough PDFs and embedded examples. These helped clarify when to use each test, how to manage assumptions, and how to interpret and present findings transparently. In combination, the exercises developed my confidence in data handling, analytical thinking, and the responsible use of statistics for applied research.</p>
