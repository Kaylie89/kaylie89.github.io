				<section>
					<p>This portfolio builds on core statistical concepts introduced in Units 7–9. Unit 7 focused on inferential statistics and hypothesis testing. This included learning how to apply conclusions to a broader population using sample data and how probability can be used to measure uncertainty. The unit also covered when to use hypothesis testing and why it helps compare values across groups, especially in contexts where estimation alone is not enough.</p>

      <p>Unit 8 moved the focus from understanding methods to working directly with data. I explored how to analyse and visualise results, particularly using quantitative datasets. While qualitative analysis was introduced conceptually, the hands-on exercises centred on Excel-based statistical tests and visual outputs. The unit also introduced the role of dashboards in modern data reporting, showing how effective visualisation supports clear communication, especially in computing and cybersecurity environments.</p>

      <p>Finally, Unit 9 highlighted the importance of research quality. I learned about validity, reliability, and generalisability and how these concepts shape both research design and data interpretation. The unit also emphasised the importance of planning analysis and presentation methods in advance, while ensuring that data is clean and accurate before concluding. These principles were applied throughout the exercises, helping to link statistical practice with broader research integrity.</p>

      <h3>Statistical Exercises Portfolio</h3>
      <p>In Units 7, 8 and 9, I worked through a series of practical statistics tasks using Excel. Each activity came with its guide and dataset, which made it easier to follow the steps and stay on track. The materials gave me a chance to practise real techniques, such as checking assumptions, running tests, and interpreting the results. Rather than just reading about these methods, I was able to apply them directly.</p>

      <p>Working through these methods helped me feel more confident when carrying out tasks such as hypothesis testing, interpreting outputs, and creating charts. I found these techniques helpful and expect they will be relevant in computing or cybersecurity roles.</p>

      <h4>Unit 8: Statistical Inference</h4>
      <p>This unit involved working through a series of exercises designed to build confidence using inferential statistical techniques. The tasks were based on work examples and required steps such as tidying up data, applying the correct test, and interpreting the results.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exe 8.1B – T-Test (Diets Dataset):</strong> This task compared weight loss between two diet plans using a two-sample t-test. I followed the instructions to verify assumptions, such as equal variances. The outcome revealed a significant difference between the groups, indicating that the diets had different effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Exe 8.2B – Chi-Square Test (Brand Preferences):</strong> A chi-square test was used to examine whether gender and brand preference were associated. The data were placed in a contingency table and analysed in Excel. The results indicated no statistically significant relationship, suggesting that gender did not influence brand choice in this dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Exe 8.3D – Pearson’s Correlation (Heather Dataset):</strong> The guidance walked through calculating correlation coefficients and scatterplots. A moderate positive correlation was found between canopy height and cover, reinforcing the importance of visualising linear relationships before concluding.</li>
        <li><strong>Exe 8.4G – One-Way ANOVA (Superplus Dataset):</strong> This task involved comparing satisfaction ratings across different product groups. The guide emphasised the importance of checking assumptions of normality and homogeneity. The results revealed a statistically significant difference, prompting the use of post hoc tests to identify which groups differed.</li>
        <li><strong>Exe 8.6C – Two-Way ANOVA (Designs Dataset):</strong> This final inferential task involved exploring the effect of two independent variables and their interaction. Following the guide’s framework, I identified the main effect of one variable and a weak interaction effect, highlighting how design and type may jointly influence user satisfaction.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All Unit 8 exercises emphasised the importance of selecting the correct test, checking assumptions, and contextualising significance levels. Interpretation guidance from the module ensured that results were explained in plain language without over-interpreting p-values.</p>

      <h4>Unit 9: Charts and Visualisation</h4>
      <p>Unit 9 focused on representing data clearly for different audiences. The workbook exercises and instructions provided guidance on chart selection and formatting best practices for ethical and accurate communication.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exe 9.1D – Descriptive Statistics and Basic Charts:</strong> In this task, I worked out averages and other key summary values, then used simple graphs to explore the data. I followed the guide’s advice to create bar charts and histograms, which helped me visualise how the data was spread and spot any skewed patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Exe 9.2D – Comparison and Trend Charts:</strong> Instructions focused on comparing group outcomes and trends over time. I produced line and clustered column charts that reflected trends in response patterns. The guide also highlighted how to label and scale axes for clarity and accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Exe 9.3B / Exa 9.3B – Pie and Stacked Column Charts:</strong> These tasks explored proportions and group breakdowns. The guidance explained the limitations of pie charts in comparing categories and encouraged the use of stacked bar charts as an alternative. Both were created and critiqued accordingly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Each Excel file contains the original dataset, step-by-step calculations, and final visual outputs, with interpretation notes embedded as comments or captions. Screenshots and annotations show adherence to the instructions.</p>

      <p>Several exercises relied on external datasets provided separately, such as <em>Diets.xlsx</em>, <em>Brandprefs.xlsx</em>, <em>Heather.xlsx</em>, <em>Superplus.xlsx</em>, and <em>Designs.xlsx</em>. These were used as source files to perform calculations and produce final versions. Links to these base datasets are included above for transparency.</p>

      <p>I completed all tasks independently, utilising the module’s resources, including the walkthrough PDFs and in-built examples. These guided me on when to apply each test, how to check the assumptions and how to interpret the results clearly and responsibly. The exercises developed my confidence in data handling, analytical thinking, and the responsible use of statistics for applied research.</p>
