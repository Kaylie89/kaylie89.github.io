					<h3>Statistical Exercises Portfolio</h3>
					<p>This section showcases the completed statistical analysis tasks from Units 8 and 9 of the module. Each exercise has been conducted using Excel, with outputs interpreted in context to simulate real-world application in computing and cybersecurity research. The aim was to demonstrate an understanding of statistical methods and the ability to apply them independently.</p>

					<h4>Unit 8: Statistical Inference</h4>
					<p>Unit 8 focused on core inferential techniques used to explore hypotheses and compare group differences.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Exe 8.1B (Diets Dataset - T-Test)</strong><br>A two-sample t-test was performed to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in weight loss between two diet plans. The analysis revealed [insert result], supporting/refuting the hypothesis of a difference between groups.</li>
						<li><strong>Exe 8.2B (Brand Preferences - Chi-Square Test)</strong><br>A chi-square test was used to evaluate the association between brand preferences and gender. The observed chi-square statistic and corresponding p-value allowed for interpretation of whether the variables were independent.</li>
						<li><strong>Exe 8.3D (Heather Dataset - Pearson's Correlation)</strong><br>This task explored the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. A moderate/strong/weak correlation was identified, with practical implications noted for prediction scenarios in computing contexts.</li>
						<li><strong>Exe 8.4G (Superplus Dataset - One-Way ANOVA)</strong><br>One-way ANOVA was applied to compare mean customer satisfaction across multiple product groups. The post-hoc interpretation helped determine where the differences lay.</li>
						<li><strong>Exe 8.6C (Designs Dataset - Two-Way ANOVA)</strong><br>This exercise analysed the effects of two independent variables on a dependent outcome. Interactions were considered, with results interpreted in terms of main effects and interaction significance.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Each dataset was evaluated with attention to assumptions, including normality and equal variance where applicable. Interpretations are fully documented in each Excel file, alongside visual aids where relevant.</p>

					<h4>Unit 9: Charts and Visualisation</h4>
					<p>Unit 9 introduced core principles of statistical visualisation. These tasks developed my skills in presenting findings clearly and appropriately for different audiences.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Exe 9.1D (Descriptive Statistics and Basic Charts)</strong><br>Key metrics such as mean, median, and mode were calculated, and visualised using bar charts and histograms. These skills are vital for pre-analysis diagnostics and communicating data distributions.</li>
						<li><strong>Exe 9.2D (Comparison and Trend Charts)</strong><br>Comparative data across groups and time were presented using clustered column and line graphs. Insights were drawn regarding trends over time and group differences.</li>
						<li><strong>Exe 9.3B and Exa 9.3B (Pie Charts and Stacked Columns)</strong><br>These charts were created to represent categorical distributions. The exercises helped critique the usefulness and limitations of pie charts, and enhanced understanding of effective visual communication.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Summary</h4>
					<p>All outputs are accessible in the accompanying Excel workbooks. Each file contains:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The original dataset used</li>
						<li>Statistical calculations</li>
						<li>Graphical representations</li>
						<li>Written interpretations explaining the results</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Together, these exercises provide evidence of the development of my statistical reasoning and technical skills. They also demonstrate independent working, data handling confidence, and the ability to critically interpret statistical outputs in the context of applied computing and cybersecurity.</p>
