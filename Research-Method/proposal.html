					<h3>Learning Outcomes Addressed</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.</li>
						<li>Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.</li>
						<li>Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.</li>
						<li>Produce and evaluate critically the resulting research proposal for the chosen topic.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Evaluation of the Research Proposal</h3>

					<p><strong>Knowledge and Understanding:</strong> The proposal demonstrated a strong understanding of the intersections between cybersecurity, defence, and adversarial AI. It addressed a clear research gap and articulated a precise aim supported by well-defined objectives. Core theoretical areas such as strategic deception and dual-use AI risks were addressed with accuracy and insight.</p>

					<p><strong>Criticality:</strong> The inclusion of multiple frameworks (PRISMA, STRIDE, and threat modelling) reflected a thoughtful approach to method design. While the evaluation of the adversarial threat landscape was thorough, a more detailed critique of alternative threat modelling options and ethical dilemmas in dual-use AI research would have enhanced critical balance.</p>

					<p><strong>Use of Sources:</strong> The presentation included a carefully curated set of interdisciplinary references, combining foundational AI security research with classical deception theory. All references were correctly formatted and sourced from reputable academic and industry bodies. This supported the proposal’s academic strength and domain relevance.</p>

					<p><strong>Structure and Presentation:</strong> The slide deck followed a coherent structure with logical transitions. Icons, timelines, and concise bullet points helped clarify complex topics. Visual elements were clean and supported understanding without overcrowding. A final slide summarising key risks and ethical issues could improve future presentations.</p>

					<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> All content was correctly attributed using in-slide citations and a full reference list. The proposal avoided any overreliance on one source and demonstrated independent synthesis of material. The integration of ethical guidance from CyBOK and the BCS further showed responsible research conduct.</p>
