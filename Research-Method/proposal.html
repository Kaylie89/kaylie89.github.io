					<h3>Learning Outcomes Addressed</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.</li>
						<li>Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.</li>
						<li>Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.</li>
						<li>Produce and evaluate critically the resulting research proposal for the chosen topic.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Evaluation of the Research Proposal</h3>

					<p><strong>Knowledge and Understanding:</strong> The proposal demonstrated a strong grasp of the intersections between cybersecurity, defence, and adversarial AI. It identified a novel research gap and presented a clear aim underpinned by precise objectives. The exploration of strategic deception, nuclear risk, and dual-use AI issues showed both depth and conceptual maturity.</p>

					<p><strong>Criticality:</strong> The integration of frameworks such as PRISMA, STRIDE, and threat modelling demonstrated an organised and layered research approach. While the proposal explored the adversarial threat landscape effectively, more detailed discussion of alternative modelling frameworks and the rationale for selecting PRISMA and STRIDE would have enhanced the evaluative rigour. Reflecting on ethical tensions in dual-use AI scenarios could also have broadened the critical lens.</p>

					<p><strong>Use of Sources:</strong> The reference list was well curated and demonstrated wide engagement with interdisciplinary literature, including adversarial AI, cybersecurity policy, and classical strategic studies. Source integration throughout the proposal was consistent and contributed to both contextual framing and methodological justification.</p>

					<p><strong>Structure and Presentation:</strong> The slides followed a logical and uncluttered sequence, with timelines, visuals, and consistent formatting aiding clarity. The balance between visual simplicity and academic density was appropriate. Future versions could benefit from a final slide summarising key risks and ethical tensions to consolidate the narrative.</p>

					<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> The proposal maintained high academic standards, with correct referencing and clear attribution. In-slide citations and a comprehensive reference list were used appropriately. The inclusion of CyBOK and BCS ethical considerations reinforced commitment to responsible research practice.</p>
